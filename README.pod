=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Number::Format> is a very useful module, however in environments with many
systems it can be a liability due to the fact that it gathers its default
settings from the system locale, which can lead to surprising results when
formatting numbers in production.

Number::Format::FixedLocale is a sub-class of L<Number::Format> that contains
only a slightly modified constructor, which will only use a fixed set of en_US
default settings. Thus any results from this module will be predictable no
matter how the system it is being run on is configured.
